# ElevenLabs Account Blocked - Complete Solution Guide

## 🚨 Current Situation

**Error**: `detected_unusual_activity - Free Tier usage disabled`

**What this means**: ElevenLabs has **flagged your account** and disabled free tier access. This is NOT a quota issue - it's their **abuse prevention system**.

## ✅ Your Pipeline is Working!

The good news:
- ✅ Upload works
- ✅ PDF processing works  
- ✅ Gemini analysis works (extracting dialogues)
- ❌ Only TTS (audio generation) is blocked

**Everything except ElevenLabs is functioning perfectly.**

## 🎯 Solutions (Choose ONE)

### Solution 1: Enable Mock TTS (IMMEDIATE - For Testing) 🧪

**Use this to test the rest of your pipeline without audio.**

#### Step 1: Enable Mock Mode

Edit `routers/upload.py` line 5-7:

**Change from:**
```python
from services.tts_service import generate_audio_tracks
# Uncomment the line below to use MOCK TTS (for testing without ElevenLabs)
# from services.tts_service_mock import generate_audio_tracks_mock as generate_audio_tracks
```

**Change to:**
```python
# from services.tts_service import generate_audio_tracks
# Uncomment the line below to use MOCK TTS (for testing without ElevenLabs)
from services.tts_service_mock import generate_audio_tracks_mock as generate_audio_tracks
```

#### Step 2: Restart Server

```bash
# Stop server (CTRL+C)
python main.py
```

#### Step 3: Test Upload

Upload your PDF - it will now create **silent audio files** and complete the pipeline.

**What you'll get**:
- ✅ Video file generated
- ✅ Subtitles working
- ✅ Panel timing correct
- ⚠️ No actual voice audio (silent)

**Use this to**:
- Test multi-page processing
- Verify Gemini analysis
- Check video generation
- Test subtitle synchronization

### Solution 2: Upgrade to Paid Plan (RECOMMENDED) 💳

**Cost**: $5/month (Starter plan)
**Limits**: 30,000 characters/month

#### Why This is Best:
- ✅ No abuse detection
- ✅ Higher limits
- ✅ Better voice quality
- ✅ Commercial use allowed
- ✅ Priority support

#### How to Upgrade:

1. **Go to ElevenLabs**:
   https://elevenlabs.io/app/subscription

2. **Choose Starter Plan**: $5/month

3. **Get New API Key**:
   - Go to Settings → API Keys
   - Create new key
   - Copy it

4. **Update `.env` file**:
   ```env
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_new_paid_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Restart server**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Solution 3: Try New Free Account (RISKY) ⚠️

**Warning**: May get blocked again if not done carefully.

#### Requirements:
- ✅ Different email address
- ✅ Different IP address (different network, NOT VPN)
- ✅ Wait 24-48 hours before heavy use
- ✅ Don't test rapidly (max 1-2 requests per minute)

#### Steps:

1. **Create new account** at https://elevenlabs.io
   - Use completely different email
   - Use different network (mobile hotspot, different WiFi)
   - Don't use VPN

2. **Get API key**:
   - Go to Settings → API Keys
   - Copy key

3. **Update `.env`**:
   ```env
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Test carefully**:
   - Start with 1-page PDF
   - Wait 1-2 minutes between tests
   - Don't abuse it

**Risk**: They may detect and block this too.

### Solution 4: Switch to Google Cloud TTS (FREE) 🆓

**Free Tier**: 1 million characters/month (way more than ElevenLabs)

#### Advantages:
- ✅ Much higher free quota
- ✅ No abuse detection issues
- ✅ Reliable
- ✅ Good quality

#### Disadvantages:
- ⚠️ Requires Google Cloud account
- ⚠️ Slightly more setup
- ⚠️ Voice quality slightly lower than ElevenLabs

#### Setup (I can help with this):

1. Create Google Cloud account
2. Enable Text-to-Speech API
3. Get credentials
4. Update code to use Google TTS

**Let me know if you want me to implement this.**

## 📝 Why ElevenLabs Blocked You

From your description:
> "I have just shared a new API key from another account"

**This triggered their abuse detection**:
- Multiple free accounts from same IP = red flag
- They specifically mention: "creating multiple free accounts"
- Their system detected the pattern

**Their message says**:
> "Free Tier only works if users do not abuse it, for example by creating multiple free accounts."
