## 🔧 What Changed

### Old Code (SLOW):
```python
for dialogue in dialogues:
    engine.save_to_file(text, file)
    engine.runAndWait()  # ❌ Blocks for each dialogue
```

### New Code (FAST):
```python
# Queue all commands
for dialogue in dialogues:
    engine.save_to_file(text, file)  # Just queue

# Run once for ALL
engine.runAndWait()  # ✅ Single batch execution
```
