## 🎯 What to Do Based on Results

### If SUCCESS ✅
**Congratulations!** Your pipeline is working. You can now:
1. Test with multi-page PDFs
2. Check video quality
3. Verify emotions are correct
4. Test subtitle synchronization

### If FAILURE ❌
Your new ElevenLabs API key is also blocked. You have 3 options:

#### Option 1: Upgrade to Paid Plan ($5/month)
- Go to https://elevenlabs.io/app/subscription
- Choose "Starter" plan
- Get new API key from paid account
- Update `.env` file
- **This will work 100%**

#### Option 2: Enable Mock TTS (Test Without Audio)
Edit `routers/upload.py` lines 5-7:
```python
# Comment line 5:
# from services.tts_service import generate_audio_tracks

# Uncomment line 7:
from services.tts_service_mock import generate_audio_tracks_mock as generate_audio_tracks
```

This creates silent videos so you can test the rest of the pipeline.

#### Option 3: Switch to Google Cloud TTS (Free)
Let me know and I'll implement it. Free tier: 1 million characters/month.

## 📞 What to Tell Me After Testing

Please share:
1. **Did it succeed or fail?**
2. **What error code did you see?** (if failed)
3. **Copy the terminal logs** (especially the error section)

This will help me provide the exact solution you need.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Start Small
Test with 1-page PDF first, not a 50-page manga.

### Keep Terminal Visible
You'll see exactly what's happening in real-time.

### Check Immediately
If it fails, scroll up in terminal to see where it failed.

### Save Logs
If you get an error, copy the terminal output for debugging.
